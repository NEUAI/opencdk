# OpenCDK

**What is this?** The place to collaborate on an open-source C++ implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.

**Download** and install the open-source CDK for most popular Linux distributions. (Not available currently)

**Learn how to use the CDK** to write applications for a wide range of environments.

**Hack on the CDK itself**, right here in the OpenCDK Community: Browse the code on the web, clone a Mercurial repository to make a local copy, and contribute a patch to fix a bug, enhance an existing component, or define a new feature.
